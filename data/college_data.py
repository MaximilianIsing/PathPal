CRITICAL: When exact data is not available, provide reasonable approximations based on:

- Public data sources and typical ranges for that category
- General knowledge about US colleges

PREFER APPROXIMATIONS OVER NULL VALUES. Use null ONLY when absolutely no reasonable estimate can be made.

Return this JSON structure:
{{

    "size_category": "Small (<5000), Medium (5000-15000), or Large (>15000) - estimate based on college type",
    "acceptance_rate": decimal 0.0-1.0 (approximate from selectivity: highly selective 0.1-0.2, selective 0.3-0.6, less selective 0.6-0.9),
    "sat_50th_percentile": integer (approximate median SAT - use ranges: elite 1450+, selective 1300-1450, moderate 1100-1300, less selective <1100),
    "act_50th_percentile": integer (approximate median ACT - convert from SAT if needed: SAT 1400≈ACT 32, SAT 1300≈ACT 28, SAT 1200≈ACT 25),

    "region": "Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest, or West (required - infer from state)",
    "popular_majors": ["major1", "major2", "major3"] (common majors for college type or typical liberal arts/business/STEM if unknown),
    "median_earnings_10_years": integer dollars (approximate: $30k-50k typical, $50k-80k selective, $80k+ elite),
    "campus_setting": "Urban, Suburban, or Rural (approximate from city size if unknown)",
    "test_optional": boolean (true if SAT/ACT not required - many schools are now test optional, estimate from selectivity tier),
    "application_deadline_fall": "YYYY-MM-DD or 'Rolling' or 'Varies'" (typical: Jan 1 for regular, Nov 1-15 for early action/decision),
    "application_fee": integer dollars (approximate typical: $50-75, some waived, estimate $50 if unknown),
    "average_financial_aid": integer dollars per year (approximate: Private often $15k-30k, Public $5k-10k, estimate based on type),
    "percent_receiving_aid": decimal 0.0-1.0 (approximate typical: Private 0.7-0.9, Public 0.5-0.7),
    "transfer_acceptance_rate": decimal 0.0-1.0 (approximate: often similar to freshman rate, estimate from main acceptance rate),

    "longitude": float (approximate longitude for city/state - use major city in state if unknown),
    "housing_available": boolean (true if on-campus housing - most 4-year colleges have housing, estimate true),
    "ipeds_id": "IPEDS ID if known" or null
}}

Approximation guidelines:
- Public universities: lower tuition ($5k-15k in-state), larger size, moderate-high acceptance rates
- Private universities: higher tuition ($20k-60k), varied size, more selective generally
- Liberal arts colleges: small-medium size, private, higher graduation rates, liberal arts majors
- Research universities: large, higher graduation rates, STEM/business majors
- State flagship: large public, moderate-high selectivity, good outcomes
